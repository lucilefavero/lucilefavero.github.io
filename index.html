   <h2>Bio</h2>
          Lucile Favero is a researcher in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. She obtained a Master's in Mathematics and a Master's in neuroscience from the University of Geneva. She will begin her PhD under the supervision of director Nuria Oliver at ELLIS Alicante in November. 
 
Thanks to her master's in mathematics, she attained a solid theoretical background, including good knowledge in numerical methods and analysis, modeling, and statistical machine learning. In her mathematics master thesis: "A machine learning-based surrogate model to optimize performance of large air-to-water heat-pump in existing building" supervised by Sylvain Sardy (and obtained with the highest grade of 6), she built a model that mimics a heat-pump numerical simulation while cutting down on calculation time. This work gives an unprecedented global understanding of the dynamics of the heat-pump and provides a practical solution to improve its environmental and technical performance.
 
In parallel with neuroscience courses, the master of neuroscience provides a two-year internship in a laboratory, where students carry out their own projects. Lucile Favero did her internship in the El-Boustani laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Giulio Matteucci. In the context of goal-directed decision-making tasks, mice exhibit distinct behavioral states induced by different levels of thirst-related motivation and can remain stuck in seemingly suboptimal strategies. In her project, "Rational design of goal-directed behavioral task in mice", she developed a Matlab-based graphical user interface and simulation engine to compute and visualize the expected reward rate for different decisional policies and task settings. In order to replicate actual behavior, she implemented an agent that updates its policy using a biased random walk. The goal is to integrate into this model factors that influence mouse decisions: learning, exploration, habituation, thirst-related motivation, homeostatic weight regulation... From a practical point of view, this work aims to help experimenters design, analyze, and improve behavioral tasks for rodents, other animals, and humans.
